Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, simulating birds' flocking behavior and related group motion.

# FEATURES
This simulation uses steering behaviours to control agent movement.
It currently implements the three core Boids behaviours from Reynolds' model, with support for adding and customizing new behaviours.

Cohesion: Agents steer toward the average position of nearby agents.

Separation: Agents avoid crowding by steering away from close neighbors.

Alignment: Agents adjust their velocity to match the direction and speed of nearby agents.
